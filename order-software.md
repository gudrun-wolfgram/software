# Ordering software

You have two options for ordering software for your server. You can order it as part of your initial provisioning of a server, or you can add it to an existing server using an OS reload.

**Note:** Not all software options are available for all server types and not all software options are the same for monthly and hourly billing.

## Provisioning software with a new server
As part of the provisioning process for bare-metal or virtual servers, you can select system addons, storage addons, and service addons:
* [Getting started with bare metal servers](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/bare-metal/about.html#getting-started-with-bare-metal-servers)
* [Getting started with virtual servers](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/vsi/vsi_index.html#getting-started-with-virtual-servers)

## Ordering software on an existing server
Follow the [OS Reload](../software/vsi_reload_os.html) procedure. Select **edit** from the Installed Software categories and select the software to add.
