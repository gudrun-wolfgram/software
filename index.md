# Welcome to {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} Software

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} has strategic relationships with vendors to provide month-to-month licenses on 32-bit and 64-bit compatible software.  When you order a device, you select the type of operating system and software for your device. You can add more software to your device within the customer portal and change to another operating system by performing an OS reload <!-- (../managing/perform-os-reload-device.html)--> on your existing device. The IBM automated system provisions software onto your server by using best practice guidelines of each vendor to ensure maximum stability and availability.

Here is a list of currently supported software:
https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/cloud-server-software

If you need software that is not currently supported, use your root access to the server to install and configure your own version of that software.  To return to a supported version on your device, perform an OS reload.

For software documentation, refer to the documentation of the vendor who produces the software.

In the cases that are described in this section, IBM includes instructions or considerations for using products in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} environment.
